# [Smash Champs Elo Rank Website]([url](https://smash-champs-elo-rank.lovable.app/))

Welcome to the Smash Champs Badminton score tracking ELO ranking system. This is a project inspired by the LTT/WAN show discussion about LLMs. In that episode Linus mentioned trying to use ChatGPT to vibe code a website and his various struggles with that. And this is a proof of concept demonstrating that with a handful of prompts and just the free tier of credits you can get something that is almost entirely functional leveraging the [Lovable]([url](https://lovable.dev/)) vibe coding platform as well as the [Supabase]([url](https://supabase.com/)) add-on which is all included in a free tier.

Take a look at the demo here.

# Prompts

First I used Superwhispere to convert Linus' description on the WAN show into text.

```
So, <strong>GPT-4</strong>, and I was like, all right, here's what I want to do. I want to create <em>an ELO rating system for players</em> so that instead of when we play our games week to week, going up a court or down a court, which can be really confusing if you have inconsistent attendance, right? Because if someone goes up from court three to court two, and then the next week they don't attend, and then someone else goes up from court three to court two, and then they both show up the following week, who's on court two? I don't know. Who knows? So an ELO system would just take the games that you play, kind of like <ins>chess</ins> or like playing ranked matches in an online game, <ins>Starcraft</ins>, <ins>COD</ins>, whatever. An ELO system would just take every match you play, and then you would either vampire points away from your opponent, or you would give up points to your opponent, depending on the result of the match. And the bigger the, like the MMR or ELO rating disparity there is between you, the greater the number of points that the lesser player would vampire away, and the fewer points that the higher rated player would take away. It's supposed to, I think too, it's supposed to have 75% probability of accurately predicting the outcome is what sort of the math targets. So anyway, I want an ELO system, and I want it to, I want to have the ability to create a player list, take attendance, print out the match sheets for the night, have an interface where you can punch those match sheets back in, and then it will create a log of the games all the players have played, and of their movement in ELO over time. Honestly, that's hardly even a program.
```

I then took that transcript and put it into ChatGPT to generate a more focused prompt for a vibe coding agent

```
Here is a verbal description of an app idea for Smash Champs badminton arena

Take all the details from this description and come up with a prompt for developer
It should include key features, capabilities, and all relevant information

Then I will let the developer build it 
```

Which generated the following output

```
Here's a clean, structured prompt you can give to a developer that captures the essence and technical requirements of your Smash Champs Badminton Arena ELO system app:

üîß Developer Prompt: Smash Champs ELO Rating System App
üéØ Objective:
Build a lightweight web or mobile application to manage and track badminton player skill levels over time using an ELO rating system. The goal is to eliminate manual and inconsistent court assignment methods by introducing a transparent and fair ranking system.

üß© Core Features:
üìã Player Management

Create, edit, and remove players.

Each player should have a unique ID, name, current ELO rating, and match history.

Allow tracking of inactive players (who didn‚Äôt attend but still exist in the system).

üìÜ Attendance Tracking

Weekly attendance tracking system.

Ability to mark which players are present on a given night.

Only attendees are considered for match generation that evening.

üìÑ Match Sheet Generation

Automatically generate balanced matchups based on ELO rankings.

Allow configurable number of courts and players per court (e.g., singles or doubles).

Export or print match sheets for physical distribution before play starts.

üéÆ Match Result Entry

Interface to input results after matches are played.

Specify winners and losers for each match.

Support singles and doubles (optionally track teams or individual contributions).

üìà ELO Rating System

Implement the ELO rating formula to update player ratings based on match results.

Include ELO parameters such as:

Default starting ELO (e.g., 1000)

K-factor (adjustable constant for ELO volatility)

Win probability calculation

Greater ELO swings when upsets occur

üìä Stats & History

Player history log: list of past matches, opponents, win/loss, and ELO change.

Graph of ELO rating over time per player.

Weekly rankings / leaderboard view.

Ability to view prior weeks‚Äô matchups and outcomes.

üß† System Behavior Notes:
The ELO system should ensure that matches between closely ranked players result in small ELO adjustments, while larger upsets result in bigger changes.

ELO changes should account for the rating difference between players (e.g., using a logistic curve).

The app should ideally predict a 75% outcome accuracy if ELO ratings are accurate.

üõ†Ô∏è Platform Requirements:
Web app or mobile app (React or React Native preferred, but open to suggestions).

Back-end with persistent storage (SQLite, Postgres, Firebase, etc.).

Admin interface for managing players, attendance, and results.

Optionally: export data as CSV or JSON for backup/reporting.

üß™ Optional/Nice-to-Haves:
Authentication layer for organizers (simple login or invite-only access).

Ability to form doubles teams and handle team ELO ratings.

Weekly recap emails or Slack summaries with results and new rankings.

Light/dark mode UI.

Let me know if you need mockups, sample data, or any clarification during development. Priority is simplicity and reliability ‚Äî this is mostly a glorified spreadsheet with ELO logic under the hood.

Let me know if you'd like to turn this into a spec document, GitHub issue template, or anything else for onboarding!
```


There are a few assumption made here that I knew I didn't want in the final product or I expected might cause the LLM issues. So I gave it an edited prompt below

```

I put that exact prompt into Lovable and got the following response

```
I love this concept! A badminton ELO rating system would be a fantastic way to bring fairness and transparency to court assignments. This is a comprehensive application that would really benefit the badminton community.

However, before I can start building this app, you'll need to set up backend functionality since this project requires:

- **Database storage** for player profiles, ELO ratings, match history, and attendance records
- **Persistent data management** to track ELO changes over time
- **Data relationships** between players, matches, and attendance records

Lovable has a native integration with Supabase that's perfect for this type of application. Supabase will provide:

- **Database tables** for players, matches, attendance, and ELO history
- **Real-time updates** so multiple people can manage the system simultaneously  
- **Authentication** if you want to restrict who can modify results
- **Automatic backups** of all your badminton data

To get started, please click on the **green Supabase button** on the top right of the interface and connect to Supabase. This will enable all the backend functionality needed for your ELO rating system.

Once that's set up, I can build you a beautiful, comprehensive badminton management system with:

‚úÖ **Player Management Dashboard** with ELO tracking  
‚úÖ **Weekly Attendance Interface** with quick check-in  
‚úÖ **Smart Match Generation** based on ELO balance  
‚úÖ **Result Entry System** with instant ELO updates  
‚úÖ **Player Statistics & History** with charts and trends  
‚úÖ **Printable Match Sheets** for court assignments  

Supabase integration docs
```

Lovable now partners with Supabase for a fast "serverless" Postgres + Functions backend that is "free" for limited use cases. I had an existing Supabase account and I went through the process of connecting Lovable to Supabaase so their agent could create a new project and configure postgres tables.

```
Please connect my supabase project `smash-champs`
```

And now Lovable can go ahead and make a working backend in Supabase.
```
It looks like you haven't created any tables in your Supabase project yet.

project_id = "ujafvexrxepuopgvbepf"

## Your app is now connected to Supabase

You can now work with a fully featured backend and add powerful features to make your app truly functional.

### 1. User Accounts and Login
- Enable sign-up and login with options like email/password or social logins (Google, Twitter, GitHub).

### 2. Store and Use Real Data
- Save app data (e.g., user profiles, posts) and show up-to-date info to users.

### 3. Add Advanced Features (Edge Functions)
You can now add powerful backend features like:
- Add features like AI endpoints, email notifications, payments, and scheduled tasks.

**Important Note**: Before you deploy your app to production or use any real data, you will need to review and set up the appropriate RLS policies. I can help with that.

### What's Next?
Just keep building! For any questions, just ask.

If you plan to have users log in, we highly recommend setting up authentication first, before adding any other features.

```
Great, <strong>Super Bass</strong> is now connected. Let's build the app now.
```

It first generates the SQL for the tables that is plans to create.

```
I'll create the database schema for the ELO rating system and then build the app. Let me start with the database tables.

-- Create players table
CREATE TABLE public.players (
  id UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  current_elo INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1000,
  is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Create attendance table
CREATE TABLE public.attendance (
  id UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  player_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.players(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  session_date DATE NOT NULL,
  present BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(player_id, session_date)
);

-- Create matches table
CREATE TABLE public.matches (
  id UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  session_date DATE NOT NULL,
  court_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  match_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (match_type IN ('singles', 'doubles')),
  player1_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.players(id),
  player2_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.players(id),
  player3_id UUID REFERENCES public.players(id), -- for doubles
  player4_id UUID REFERENCES public.players(id), -- for doubles
  winner_ids UUID[] NOT NULL, -- array of winning player IDs
  is_completed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Create ELO history table
CREATE TABLE public.elo_history (
  id UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  player_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.players(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  match_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.matches(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  elo_before INTEGER NOT NULL,
  elo_after INTEGER NOT NULL,
  elo_change INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE public.players ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.attendance ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.matches ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.elo_history ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies (public access for demo purposes)
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on players" 
ON public.players 
FOR ALL 
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on attendance" 
ON public.attendance 
FOR ALL 
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on matches" 
ON public.matches 
FOR ALL 
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on elo_history" 
ON public.elo_history 
FOR ALL 
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Create function to update timestamps
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.updated_at = now();
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Create trigger for automatic timestamp updates
CREATE TRIGGER update_players_updated_at
  BEFORE UPDATE ON public.players
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.update_updated_at_column();

-- Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX idx_attendance_session_date ON public.attendance(session_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_matches_session_date ON public.matches(session_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_elo_history_player_id ON public.elo_history(player_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_elo_history_match_id ON public.elo_history(match_id);
```


The only input needed from me was to confirm I wanted Lovable to run these migrations

```
I have reviewed the SQL and it looks good. Please run it.
```

And then finally Lovable started building out the frontend part of this project. Note: In their UI these file edits are compacted into clickable links and hidden as part of the thinking process.

```
Perfect! The database schema is set up with only one minor security warning remaining (OTP expiry threshold). Now I'll build the Smash Champs ELO rating system interface.

Perfect! The Smash Champs ELO rating system is now complete and ready to use.

**What was built:**

‚úÖ **Database Schema** - Players, attendance, matches, and ELO history tables with proper RLS policies
‚úÖ **Player Management** - Add, edit, activate/deactivate players  
‚úÖ **Rankings Leaderboard** - Real-time ELO rankings with recent changes
‚úÖ **Attendance Tracker** - Mark players present for each session
‚úÖ **Match Generator** - Auto-generate balanced singles/doubles matches with printable sheets
‚úÖ **Match Results** - Record winners and automatically calculate ELO changes using proper formula
‚úÖ **Player Statistics** - Individual stats, win rates, ELO history, and recent form

The system implements a proper ELO rating algorithm where players start at 1000 points, and ratings adjust based on match outcomes and opponent strength. The app is fully functional and ready for your badminton club to start tracking player skill levels transparently!

The output of this was fantastic. It had every feature Linus had requested, even the ability to generate PDF score sheets for all the matches of the Day.
However while I knew the backend had player tracking and game scoring, there was no UI affordance to upload results.

So I had to do another prompt

```
This looks great. Generating the match sheet works great as well. However, <ins>there's no way for me to upload match results.</ins>
```

And Lovable asked me some clarifying questions before proceeding.

```
I'll quickly check the homepage and routing to see if the Match Results component exists but isn't linked. If missing, I'll add a visible "Match Results" tab/section on the main page so you can upload results.

I‚Äôll point you to where to record results: use the ‚ÄúResults‚Äù tab, pick the session date, then click the ‚ÄúWins‚Äù buttons to save and update ELO. Do you need set scores or a CSV/photo upload flow instead?
```

To which I replied the following. Given more time and credits I probably could have guided it through some CSV upload or even integrated with an OCR library.

```
 The expected flow is that a user will go to Generate,
Create a bunch of PDFs of each matchup
Then games will be played
And then a scorer will write down the resutls on paper>
At the end of the day someone can manually input results into the system.D
Do not need to parse a file
```

And I got this response

```
Plan: I‚Äôll check how the Results UI is wired by reading Index.tsx, MatchResults.tsx, and App.tsx. Then I‚Äôll add a clear ‚ÄúEnter Results‚Äù tab with manual winner selection if missing, without changing logic.

Enter Results\",\"search\":\"            Results\"}">

\\n      \\n      \\n        Select the session date, then click the \\\"Wins\\\" button for each match to record results and update ELO.\\n      \\n\\n      \",\"search\":\"      \\n\\n      \"}">

I‚Äôll make the Results flow clearer for manual entry by renaming the tab and adding an inline instruction.

- Renamed ‚ÄúResults‚Äù tab to ‚ÄúEnter Results‚Äù
- Added a short note at the top of the Results page explaining: select the session date, then click the ‚ÄúWins‚Äù button for each match to record results and update ELO
```
Which generated a fully working app!

# Conclusion
 I am sure there are problems lurking somewhere here, however Lovable did an excellent job with minimal guidance from me, mostly adhering to the original prompt from Linus. However, the visual impact of having a fully clickable, responsive web-app that does what the user intends is a huge win. Lovable connects to Github and this is that repository. Its much easier to hand off a fully working proof-of-concept to a professional developer to add features or modify functionality if they no longer want to use Lovable. Also a PoC helps define constraints on what the website should and should not do, which would make hiring a development contract shop to finish it much less risky.
